Power BI Dashboard 

This project has been a great learning journey, combining data analysis and visualization skills. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the steps involved:

1)	Data Wrangling: wrangled data from CSV files into a SQL database, then connected that database to Power BI for seamless data access.

2)	Power Up with Power Query: transformed and cleaned the data in Power Query Editor, ensuring it was ready for analysis.

3)	The Magic of DAX: created new columns and insightful measures using DAX functions, unlocking the power of the data.

4)	Dual Dashboards for Double Insights: built two distinct dashboards: Credit Card Transaction Report: Detailed analysis of transaction volume, types, amounts, and trends.

Credit Card Customer Report: Customer demographics, spending behavior, credit limits, and targeted insights.

5)	Visualization Powerhouse: Packed each dashboard with charts, KPIs, and other visuals to make the data easily understandable.
